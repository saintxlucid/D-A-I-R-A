# DAIRA Golden User Journey

First Visit

You open DAIRA. Instead of a busy feed, you see a map of districts—places shaped around interests, creativity, or local communities.

Choose Your Mask

You pause for a moment to pick:
- Citizen—just yourself,
- Artist—to share or follow creative work,
- Business—for things like organizing or local offers.

Choosing doesn’t feel like a big deal. It’s just setting your mood for today.

Step Into a District

You click into a district—maybe for local music, or a community project, or just your city. The page settles. You see events coming up, a few open rooms, what’s happening right now.

“Why this?”

You spot an event that looks interesting. Next to it, there’s a small “Why this?” link.
You tap—it says:
“This came from your Artist circle, and you follow local music.”
That’s it. You get it. If it doesn’t fit, you can mute or adjust.

Change What You See

You fiddle with discovery sliders for a minute.
Want more from friends, less from public announcements? It responds, right away. You feel like the platform listens.

Create Something

You record a quick audio hello, or snap a photo, and send it to your circle or just the district.
You don’t have to chase likes. It’s out there for the right people, and that’s enough.

The Feeling

What you do shows up for who you meant it for—no mystery gaps, nothing feels lost or shouted into the void.
You know why things are there. You know why you’re seen.

You close DAIRA and feel settled—not spun up.
