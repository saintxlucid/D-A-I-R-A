# Blueprints Directory

This folder contains technical blueprints and templates for implementations within the D-A-I-R-A project. 

Use these documents to:
- Propose, discuss, and document new features or architectural changes
- Standardize implementation specs
- Provide clear, structured guidance for contributors

Each new implementation should start with a copy of the `blueprint-template.md` file, filled out and committed as a separate document in this directory.
