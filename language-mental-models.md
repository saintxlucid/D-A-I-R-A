# DAIRA Language & Mental Models

District:
A district is just a digital neighborhood. Each one has its own feel, its own people, its own way of doing things.

Orbit:
An orbit is a quiet assistant for your posts—it helps share what you make with the right circles or districts, on your terms.

“Why this?”:
“Why this?” tells you—clearly—why you’re seeing any post or event. It’s not pretending; it’s just honest about how things work.
