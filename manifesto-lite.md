# DAIRA Manifesto-Lite

You’re not a product.
You’re not here to be farmed for clicks, kept guessing, or put on stage.

You’re a person with roles, moods, and boundaries. DAIRA is a place for that—no tricks, no games.

Reputation comes from how you contribute, not how loud you are.
Discovery is clear, tweakable, and never hidden.
You can switch roles, try things, and always see the rules.

It’s easy to export your data, take a break, or just leave—no lock-in, ever.

For anyone tired of noise and hype, DAIRA is a calm, living place to be yourself, find community, and move on your own terms.
