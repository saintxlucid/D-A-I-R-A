# DAIRA Governance (How it Feels)

Let’s say something you shared is hidden. DAIRA doesn’t just remove it quietly.
You’ll see a notice explaining what rule applied and an option to appeal or edit.

If you appeal, someone from the community (a steward) checks things out and lets you know what happens, publicly.
You can see rules, who moderates, and why any action was taken.

You don’t have to worry about silent bans or secret “wrong moves.” The process is visible and feels fair, even if imperfect.
