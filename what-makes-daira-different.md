# What Makes DAIRA Different

No endless feeds. Just real digital spaces.
Roles (masks) aren’t hype—they fit your day, your way.
Discovery is clear (and always explainable).
You share for meaning, not metrics.
Moderation is visible, not silent.

You’re never lost. You can always understand, participate, and shape your own experience.
